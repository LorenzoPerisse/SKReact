# SKReact v1.3
![skreact_screenshot](../assets/skreact_screenshot.png?raw=true)
A reactor neutrino simulator for Super-Kamiokande, simulating production in
reactors, oscillation to SK, cross section for IBD on free protons, and detector
smearing. Built referencing M. Baldoncini *et al.*, *"Reference worldwide model
for antineutrinos from reactors"*,
[arXiv:1411.6475v2](https://arxiv.org/abs/1411.6475).


## Installation and Running
SKReact uses python 3(.7.0), it does not support python 2.
Install the required modules using pip: 

`$ pip install -r requirements.txt`.

If it is your first time running and you don't have a `reactors_main.pkl` file,
you can generate your own by downloading the `.xls` files containing reactor
information from the PRIS kindly compiled by INFN
[here](https://www.fe.infn.it/radioactivity/antineutrino/index.html#download).

Download the "Input database" files (you will need to request the download), and
place the files into `react_p/` in the SKReact directory, with their names unchanged.
Simply create the directory if it does not already exist, or change the
`REACT_DIR` variable in `params.py` if you want to pull the data from somewhere
else.

The first time running without a `reactors_main.pkl` file will be very slow to
start as the relevant information needs to be pulled and compiled from the
`.xls` files. SKReact tries to handle all inconcistencies across the files and
will print any changes in reactor information as it compiles, if you want
verbose import/import errors, change the `VERBOSE_IMPORT` and
`VERBOSE_IMPORT_ERR` values in `params.py`.

Running from then on with a `reactors_main.pkl` file will be much faster on
startup. There is a chance you will need to recompile from `.xls` between
SKReact releases.


## Features

### Reactor List
![reactor_list](../assets/reactor_list.png?raw=true)

This is a list of the reactors contributing to the total spectrum at SK i.e. the
reactors imported from the PRIS. It is ordered by largest *flux* contribution at
Super-K. Select a reactor to highlight it on the spectra plots. The last
selected reactor's information will appear in the reactor info pane.

### Reactor Info
![reactor_info](../assets/reactor_info.png?raw=true)

Here you can see the relevant information about the last selected reactor. You
can edit the information as you like then click the *Update* button to
re-generate the spectra.

To edit to load factor or power information, select a value in the listbox, type
the desired value in the entry box below and hit return.

### Period Selection/Load Factor Plot
![lf](../assets/lf.png?raw=true)

This plot lets you visualise the expected reactor signal/reactor power
information, by default showing the number of interactions each month (for
the total (blue) and highlighted reactors). All values dynamically update
with reactor info changes **except** the number of interactions, which is
calculated on startup. You can select the period to focus on using the drop
boxes. NOTE: the selection is **inclusive**, i.e. the end month selected is
included in the simulation, so to inspect one month, you set both start and
end to the same month (will likely print errors with plotting to terminal, will
be fixed in future update).

### Spectrogram
![spectro](../assets/spectro.png?raw=true)

A spectrogram (calculated on startup) to visualise how the spectrum changes over
time. Currently "for show" but will make more use of this in the future.

### Produced Spectrum
![prod_spec](../assets/prod_spec.png?raw=true)

Shows the produced spectrum (/s) and n produces for the last selected reactor
(varies with reactor type). Click the checkboxes to show individual fuel
contributions (assumes fixed fuel fractions).

### Oscillated Spectrum
![osc_spec](../assets/osc_spec.png?raw=true)

The total oscillated spectrum at SK with some numbers. Can save the plot
(with its current size, will update to produce full sized plot in future), as
well as produce a `.csv` of the spectrum by selecting `.csv` as the extension
when saving. Can vary the oscillation parameters using the sliders:

![osc_slider](../assets/osc_slider.png?raw=true)

This is slow (the spectra for each reactor needs to be calculated and summed on
the fly), but is nice for visualising the main parameters' effects on the
spectra.


### Interacted Spectrum
![int_spec](../assets/int_spec.png?raw=true)

The final spectrum after multiplying the oscillated spectrum by the IBD cross
section. You can view the neutrino or positron spectrum (i.e. offset by 1.806
MeV) by selecting the radio button for each in the options.

![int_spec_options](../assets/int_spec_options.png?raw=true)

From this you can save the plot (also as `.csv` as with the oscillated
spectrum) or generate a `.nuance` file from the spectrum for input into detector
simulators (will always generate positron spectrum). 


### Smearing and Fitting

On startup, if `smear_main.csv` is found (change `WIT_SMEAR_FILE` in params.py
for other filenames) SKReact will generate a smearing matrix to multiply by the
interacted spectrum, giving a "detected" spectrum.

`smear_main.csv` contains the gaussian parameters for the reconstructed energy
from fixed energy in the detector and must be of the form (with headers):

`e,c,mu,sig,eff`

Where `e` is the energy reconstructed, `c,mu,sig` are the gaussian parameters
and `eff` is the efficiency of detection at that energy. You can generate this
yourself using your detector simulator by generating samples at fixed energies,
reconstructing them and fitting a gaussian. If you are an SK collaborator,
contact
[alexander.goldsack@physics.ox.ac.uk](alexander.goldsack@physics.ox.ac.uk) for a
WIT smearing file.

SKReact also has a (crude) fitter, which will vary selected oscillation
parameters to fit a given detected spectrum with the calculated smeared
spectrum. Click "Import data to fit" on the interacted spectrum options frame
and select a `.csv` file of format `e,bin content` (without headers). Then
select which parameters you'd like to fit, and run. The fitter cyclicly finds a
minima in a range defined under `# FITTING` in `params.py`.

![fit_win](../assets/fit_win.png?raw=true)

NOTE: The fitter in SKReact is very crude and requires some tuning and
optimisation/parallelisation.


## Contact

For any issues, suggestions, enhancements or bugs, please post an issue on
the repository's issues page. To contact me directly, please email
[alexander.goldsack@physics.ox.ac.uk](alexander.goldsack@physics.ox.ac.uk),
however please be aware my support for SKReact is primarily limited to my own
requirements and so I will have to weigh up the time/personal usefulness for any
modifications.

Please enjoy SKReact!
